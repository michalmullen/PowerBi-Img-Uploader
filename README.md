## How to Use
1. You must have access to the graphs on PowerBi.
2. Make sure that your default browser is chrome on your avast account so that when it opens it is linked to your account.
3. Run the code. It will open chrome an manually try to login.
3. Will get an SMS code on signin so you must manually add the code to login.
4. Wait for program to finish at take the screenshot.
5. It will ask weather it should save the graph images. If you didn't have enough time and didn't make it to the graphs by the time the chrome window closed slecet 'no'.

### Disclaimer
Since it is taking a screenshot and croping each image it will not work with your monitor unless it is the exact same as mine. You will have to personally change the code (crop parameters) to make it work for you.
